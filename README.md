# Course Registration & Result System (CRRS)

A Python-based command-line application designed to manage student enrolments and academic results using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and persistent file storage.

This project simulates a basic academic management system and demonstrates core programming concepts commonly used in real-world applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Student management (add, update, display)
- Course management
- Student enrolment handling
- Result recording with automatic grade calculation
- Persistent data storage using text files
- System activity logging
- Interactive command-line interface
- Error handling for robust execution

---

## 🧱 System Design

The system is built using five core classes:

- **Student** – stores student details  
- **Course** – stores course information  
- **Enrollment** – links students to courses  
- **Result** – records scores and calculates grades  
- **CRRSManager** – manages all operations and file handling

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Lists and Functions
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

---

## 📂 Data Storage

The application uses text files for persistent storage:

- `students.txt`
- `courses.txt`
- `enrollments.txt`
- `results.txt`
- `system_log.txt` (tracks system operations)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed
3. Run the application:

```bash
python file.py
```
